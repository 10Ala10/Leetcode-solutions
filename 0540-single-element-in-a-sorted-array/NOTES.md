Intuition:

The intuition behind this approach is that XOR of two same numbers is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 gives the same number. Therefore, if we take XOR of all elements in the array, the resulting value will be the element that occurs only once.

Complexity:

Time complexity:O(n)
Space complexity:O(1)
